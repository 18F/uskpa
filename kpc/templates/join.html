        Kimberley Process (KP) certificates must be issued for every export of rough diamonds from the U.S. Only USKPA licensees can issue KP certificates. Unlicensed entities wishing to export rough diamonds must obtain a KP certificate from a licensed common carrier. Entities that often export rough diamonds should consider becoming a USKPA licensee.
    </strong></p>

    <h1>How to become a USKPA Licensee</h1>

    <p>
        To become a USKPA licensee, your business must register for an Exporter Account on the U.S. Custom and Border Protectionâ€™s <a href='https://ace.cbp.dhs.gov/acexpub/acexpub_Apps/ExporterAccountApplication/expForm.php'>Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) website</a>. Once you have created an Exporter Account, <a href="mailto:{{CONTACT_US}}">contact the USKPA</a> for an application form. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your business, including the state of incorporation, address, telephone number, fax number, email address, federal tax identification number, and a point of contact for your request.
    </p>

    <p>
        After reviewing your submitted application, the USKPA will prepare a license agreement requiring a signature from your business. The USKPA will also provide procedural documentation and warranties that are required for invoices and shipping documents. As a licensee, you will be asked to:
        <li>
            Ensure the security of KP certificates in your possession.
        </li>
        <li>
            Comply with all federal regulations pertaining to the use of KP certificates for import and export of rough diamonds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fax KP certificates with U.S. and foreign jurisdiction to the proper authorities in the U.S.
        </li>
    </p>

    <p>
        All exports from the U.S. must also comply with current U.S. export reporting requirements. ACE uses the Automated Export System (AES) to ensure compliance with export reporting requirements. Upon completion and filing of export documentation, the AES will provide an Internal Transaction Number (ITN) to reference on your KP certificate. Additional guidance on obtaining ITNs is available at <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/aes/aesdirect/transitiontoace.html">ACE AESDirect Resources</a>. This includes the ACE AESDirect User Guide, information on registering for an account, a video that will walk you through filing a shipment, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
        USKPA collects an annual fee from all licensees. Licensees in good standing are entitled to purchase KP certificates from the USKPA for use in exporting rough diamonds from the U.S.
